AUTOMIRROR
==========
automirror is a simple Perl proxy that has the ability to save files of
specific extensions to disk.

It was based off of the script found here: 

    http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=684293

but has since been heavily modified.

USAGE
=====
For information on how to use the script, run

    perldoc automirror

I've included a rudimentary sysv rc file that is known to work on CentOS.
You can edit the options section of this file to configure how automirror
runs as a service.

A more detailed tutorial can be found at:

REQUIRED MODULES
================
HTTP::Proxy
HTTP::Response
HTTP::Headers
GetOpt::Long
URI::Escape
File::Slurp

KNOWN ISSUES AND LIMITATIONS
============================
It should be important to note that development of automirror has so far been
geared toward CentOS environments. That's not to say it won't work in other
environments, but it just has not been tested.

automirror can use a lot of memory depending on how large the cached file is.
I have tried various methods of cutting down on memory usage, but so far
the only method I have been able to get working with yum is read_file using
a scalar reference. Methods such as using sysread in the HTTP::Response and
send_file with HTTP::Daemon have proven troublesome.

Although streaming data over network protocols is not my strong point, I can
understand if high memory usage is kind of normal. This program caches and
sends large binary files at very high speeds -- for the system to keep up,
a lot of memory will need to be used. I can be wrong, though, and if you
have any input to this issue, please let me know.
