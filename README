AUTOMIRROR
==========

automirror is a simple Perl proxy that has the ability to save files of
specific extensions to disk.

It was based off of the script found here:
    http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=684293
but has since been heavily modified.

USAGE
=====
For information on how to use the script, run
    perldoc automirror

I've included a rudimentary sysv rc file that is known to work on CentOS.
You can edit the options section of this file to configure the script.

REQUIRED MODULES
================
HTTP::Proxy
HTTP::Response
HTTP::Headers
GetOpt::Long
URI::Escape
File::Slurp
