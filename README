AUTOMIRROR
==========

automirror is a simple Perl proxy that has the ability to save files of
specific extensions to disk.

It was based off of the script found here:
    http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=684293
but has since been heavily modified.

USAGE
=====
For information on how to use the script, run
    perldoc automirror

I've included a rudimentary sysv rc file that is known to work on CentOS.
You can edit the options section of this file to configure the script.

REQUIRED MODULES
================
HTTP::Proxy
HTTP::Response
HTTP::Headers
GetOpt::Long
URI::Escape
File::Slurp

NOTE
====
It should be important to note that development of automirror has so far been
geared toward CentOS environments. That's not to say it won't work in other
environments, but it just has not been tested.
